# The Effects of Extraversion and Social Interactions on Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic

This project was created and submitted for the course 'Case Studies in the Analysis of Experimental Data' course (second Master Theoretical and Experimental
Psychology, Ghent University). The main goal of the course is to familiarize with the process of reproducible and transparent scientific practice while working in group. 
The assignment consists of analysing a public dataset to adress our research question(s) and write a report on the choices we made in this process, the obstacles 
we encountered how we adressed these problems.
